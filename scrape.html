The object under investigation-say, a wind turbine-is equipped with a variety of sensors that monitor various aspects of its operation. These sensors collect data on the energy production, temperature, weather conditions, and other characteristics of the physical object's performance. This information is subsequently sent to a processing machine, where it is applied to a digital copy. Once the virtual model has been given this information, it may be used to run simulations, investigate performance concerns, and suggest improvements, all with the purpose of gaining important insights that can later be applied to the original physical device. In this paper methods of machine learning will be discussed, statistics, forecasting, mathematical equations, real-world examples, and methodology for building digital twins."},{"@type":"PublicationIssue","name":"GETTING RTSP TO WORK NATIVELY IN THE BROWSER","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Ashlin Darius Govindasamy","url":"https://za.linkedin.com/in/adgsenpai"},"url":"https://www.linkedin.com/redir/redirect?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww%2Embimph%2Ecom%2Findex%2Ephp%2FAJOAIR%2Farticle%2Fview%2F3032%2F2670&urlhash=0B0X","description":"Real-Time Streaming Protocol (RTSP) is an application-level network communication system that transfers real-time data from multimedia to an endpoint device by communicating directly with the server streaming the data. The Real-Time Streaming Protocol (RTSP) is tried-and-true video technology. It's used to control audio/video transmission between two endpoints and facilitate the transportation of low latency streaming content across the internet. Real-Time Streaming Protocol (RTSP) allows you to pull a live video stream from your camera and view it from different devices and programs. Its primary uses are to pull a video feed from a camera to an NVR, viewing software, or even home automation solutions. RTSP is not natively supported in Web Browsers at the time the paper was written. In this paper, I will discuss techniques on how to render RTSP natively in your web browser using only an &lt;img&gt; in HTML (HyperText Markup Language) powered by my platform which hundreds of people use today called OpenRTSP, and an alternative way to build an engine/server like my platform from scratch in detail."},{"@type":"PublicationIssue","name":"FINDING NFTS (NON-FUNGIABLE TOKENS) USING A \r\nGIVEN ETHEREUM WALLET ADDRESS AN OPEN SEA \r\nSTUDY","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Ashlin Darius Govindasamy","url":"https://za.linkedin.com/in/adgsenpai"},"url":"https://www.linkedin.com/redir/redirect?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww%2Embimph%2Ecom%2Findex%2Ephp%2FAJOAIR%2Farticle%2Fview%2F2937&urlhash=KcwN","description":"used to verify ownership of a NFT"},{"@type":"PublicationIssue","name":"Space X Falcon 9 Report","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Ashlin Darius Govindasamy","url":"https://za.linkedin.com/in/adgsenpai"},"url":"https://www.linkedin.com/redir/redirect?url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub%2Ecom%2FADGVLOGS%2FIBM-DataScience-SpaceX-Capstone%2Fblob%2Fmain%2FIBM%2520Data%2520Science%2520Capstone%2Epdf&urlhash=FEvG","description":"My Data Science SpaceX Capstone Project Research Paper to (edX IBM) and for the public to view for interest sake/assist them in doing their Capstone for IBM.

Where they charge R350 per month whereas my script is free you just need to run it on the cloud (in Rahn&#39;s cases a Raspberry Pi 4)<br /><br />To make the script run on the Pi 24/7 I had to create an image and run it in Kubernetes and Docker.<br />using a FreeTDS driver to connect to SQL.<br />https://github.com/ADGVLOGS/raspberrypi-pyodbc-docker-image<br /><br />you can find the repo here for more information.<br /><br />Website Upgrading for https://rahn.co.za/<br />I added a WooCommerce plugin on the website to add an Account and Cart page and helped register them on PayFast to accept payments for the software.<br /><br />I wrote another application as research for them such as a CV parser. The CV parser uses NLP, Machine Learning to extract the fields in any given CV format - (.png, pdf, .docx, etc) and publishes them into the SQL Database. It&#39;s not quite accurate yet has around a 60% accuracy. Fields do get messed up and mixed up.<br />Powered by C# and Python.<br /><br />Training a Rahn Employee to gain various skills such as Practical Networking (Port-forwarding, IPv4 Public and Private, Linux, SSH, Visual Studio Code - Jypyter Notebooks, httpd (Apache), SQL Server Security)<br /><br />Built Rahn Monitor with Raymond (Rahn) helping me with Front End from scratch powered by the ADGSDK.

          A digital twin is a virtual representation of a physical object that is designed to exactly reflect it. The object under investigation-say, a wind turbine-is equipped with a variety of sensors that monitor various aspects of its operation. These sensors collect data on the energy production, temperature, weather conditions, and other characteristics of the physical object&#39;s performance. This information is subsequently sent to a processing machine, where it is applied to a digital copy. Once the virtual model has been given this information, it may be used to run simulations, investigate performance concerns, and suggest improvements, all with the purpose of gaining important insights that can later be applied to the original physical device. In this paper methods of machine learning will be discussed, statistics, forecasting, mathematical equations, real-world examples, and methodology for building digital twins.

          Real-Time Streaming Protocol (RTSP) is an application-level network communication system that transfers real-time data from multimedia to an endpoint device by communicating directly with the server streaming the data. The Real-Time Streaming Protocol (RTSP) is tried-and-true video technology. It&#39;s used to control audio/video transmission between two endpoints and facilitate the transportation of low latency streaming content across the internet. Real-Time Streaming Protocol (RTSP) allows you to pull a live video stream from your camera and view it from different devices and programs. Its primary uses are to pull a video feed from a camera to an NVR, viewing software, or even home automation solutions. RTSP is not natively supported in Web Browsers at the time the paper was written. In this paper, I will discuss techniques on how to render RTSP natively in your web browser using only an &lt;img&gt; in HTML (HyperText Markup Language) powered by my platform which hundreds of people use today called OpenRTSP, and an alternative way to build an engine/server like my platform from scratch in detail.

        I predicted if the Falcon 9 first stage will land successfully. SpaceX<br />advertises Falcon 9 rocket launches on its website, with a cost of 62<br />million dollars; other providers cost upward of 165 million dollars each,<br />much of the savings is because SpaceX can reuse the first stage.<br />Therefore, if we can determine if the first stage will land, we can<br />determine the cost of a launch. This information can be used if an<br />alternate company wants to bid against SpaceX for a rocket launch.
