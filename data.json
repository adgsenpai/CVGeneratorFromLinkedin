Introduce the concept of a crypto wallet. 2. Introduce the concept of generating crypto assets by mining (Passive Income). 3. Convert your crypto assets to fiat currency. 4. Taxation laws for cryptocurrency in South Africa. 5. Using cryptocurrency in selected stores without fiat currency. 6.

The object under investigation-say, a wind turbine-is equipped with a variety of sensors that monitor various aspects of its operation. These sensors collect data on the energy production, temperature, weather conditions, and other characteristics of the physical object's performance. This information is subsequently sent to a processing machine, where it is applied to a digital copy. Once the virtual model has been given this information, it may be used to run simulations, investigate performance concerns, and suggest improvements, all with the purpose of gaining important insights that can later be applied to the original physical device. In this paper methods of machine learning will be discussed, statistics, forecasting, mathematical equations, real-world examples, and methodology for building digital twins.", "link": "https://www.linkedin.com/redir/redirect?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww%2Eresearchgate%2Enet%2Fpublication%2F361152292_Building_Digital_Twins&urlhash=ZrYV&trk=public_profile_publication-button"}, {"title": "GETTING RTSP TO WORK NATIVELY IN THE BROWSER", "subtitle": "Asian Journal of Advances in Research June 1, 2022", "description": "Real-Time Streaming Protocol (RTSP) is an application-level network communication system that transfers real-time data from multimedia to an endpoint device by communicating directly with the server streaming the data.

Real-Time Streaming Protocol (RTSP) allows you to pull a live video stream from your camera and view it from different devices and programs. Its primary uses are to pull a video feed from a camera to an NVR, viewing software, or even home automation solutions.
