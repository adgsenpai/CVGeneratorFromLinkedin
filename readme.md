# Python Selenium Setup

this repo is a simple setup for selenium with python, it uses the chrome driver and the chrome browser. It can be used to run tests on a local machine or on a remote machine. Web stuff such as scraping and automation can be done with this setup.

## Setup

- Install `Python`
- Install `pip` and then run `pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Running

In `app.py` add selenium code and run `python3 app.py`

Thus look at the `selenium` documentation for more info on how to use it that can be found @ [https://selenium-python.readthedocs.io/](https://selenium-python.readthedocs.io/)
